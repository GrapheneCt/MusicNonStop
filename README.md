# MusicNonStop
MusicNonStop disables automatic song pause ("The song has been paused" message) in games that use sceAppMgrAcquireBgmPort. Note that theoretically it may cause problems with sound in some games.
Tested in:
 Dragon's Crown (first unpatched version), Death Mark, Thomas Was Alone.
Used on per-game basis. For example if you want to use this plugin in Death Mark (TitleID is PCSE01279), install under *PCSE01279 in config.txt.
